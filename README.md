- Storing your password in Windows Credential Manager helps enhance security by keeping your credentials safe and accessible only by authorized applications.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you need to install the `CredentialManager` PowerShell module, which allows interaction with the Windows Credential Manager. Follow these steps to install the module:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator:
   - Right-click on the PowerShell icon and select "Run as administrator".

2. Install the `CredentialManager` module by executing the following command:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name CredentialManager -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

3. When prompted, confirm the installation by selecting "Yes".

## Installation

### Variables to Update Before Running the Install Script

Before executing the `install.ps1` script, you need to ensure that the following variables are correctly set in the script:

1. **$keepassPath**
   - This variable should contain the path to the KeePassXC executable. Ensure that the path is correct according to your system setup. The default is set as:
     ```powershell
     $keepassPath = "C:\Program Files\KeePassXC\KeePassXC.exe"
     ```

2. **$databasePath**
   - Update this variable with the path to your KeePass database file. The default path is set to:
     ```powershell
     $databasePath = "G:\MÃ³j dysk\KeePass\Database.kdbx"
     ```
   - Make sure to adjust this path if your database is located elsewhere.

### Running the Install Script

To ensure that the install script runs without being blocked by PowerShell's execution policies, you can execute the following command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\install.ps1"
```

### Manual Execution (When Auto-Start Fails) / Troubleshooting

In cases where the automatic startup of the KeePassXC auto-unlock script fails, you can manually trigger it using the `Run-KeePassXC-AutoUnlock.bat` file. This batch file is designed to execute the PowerShell script `keePassXC-AutoUnlock-Login-Windows.ps1` with the necessary execution policy bypass.

To use it:

1. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned this repository.
2. Double-click `Run-KeePassXC-AutoUnlock.bat`.
